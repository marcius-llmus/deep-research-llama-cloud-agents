  "writer_user_msg": "Instruction: Create a comprehensive report on Tokyo's seasonal weather based on the provided evidence. \n\nThe report should include:\n1. An introduction stating that Tokyo has four distinct seasons.\n2. A section for each season (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter) detailing:\n   - Typical temperature ranges (Highs/Lows in Celsius).\n   - Precipitation patterns and humidity levels.\n   - Key seasonal highlights (e.g., cherry blossoms in Spring, rainy season/typhoons in Summer, foliage in Autumn, snow likelihood in Winter).\n3. A compact comparison table at the end summarizing High/Low Temps, Precipitation, and Humidity for all four seasons.\n\nUse the following data points:\n- Spring: Highs 15-22C, Lows 7-14C; Precip 110-140mm; Humidity 55-65%; Cherry blossoms late March/early April.\n- Summer: Highs 28-33C, Lows 22-26C; Precip 150-210mm; Humidity 70-85%; Rainy season early summer, typhoons later.\n- Autumn: Highs 18-26C, Lows 10-18C; Precip 120-170mm; Humidity 55-70%; Foliage peaks in November.\n- Winter: Highs 8-12C, Lows 1-5C; Precip 40-70mm; Humidity 45-60%; Snow is infrequent.\n\nCite the sources as provided in the evidence summary.",
